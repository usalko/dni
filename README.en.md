# The Dark Days Manifesto

All countries have **dark forces**, but most countries take it under control.

Now Russia is not one of them. Current political system in Russia **doesn't have legal mechanisms** to stop the top manager if he or she going crazy.

**Yes, it's our problem**. I think millions of my compatriots look in horror at the current situation.
Most of our Internet providers perform wrong and destructive orders like blocking users and taking the data to the government because of the money.

To stop that, we need to use the **Dark Net** energy at that dark time.

---

I express the **Great Thanks** to the darknet volunteers. My heart is with all of you.

---

I **beg** all resources that blocked tor's traffic, **stop blocking until the war stops**.

---

For the law enforcement officers of my country:

I understand that you do the job cause feed your families.
But if it is possible, please don't perform wrong orders. Or don't do as long as you could. Wrong orders mean the orders that increase the violence level. We are all in a very dangerous situation. The Big War at the current time could be fatal for our country.

Just recollecting our faults:

* [Czechoslovakia at 1968](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw_Pact_invasion_of_Czechoslovakia)
* [Afghan at 1979](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet%E2%80%93Afghan_War)
* [And another one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine)
